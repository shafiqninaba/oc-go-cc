# oc-go-cc

A Go CLI proxy that lets you use your [OpenCode Go](https://opencode.ai/docs/go/) subscription with [Claude Code](https://docs.anthropic.com/en/docs/claude-code).

`oc-go-cc` sits between Claude Code and OpenCode Go, intercepting Anthropic API requests, transforming them to OpenAI format, and forwarding them to OpenCode Go's endpoint. Claude Code thinks it's talking to Anthropic — but your requests go to affordable open models instead.

## Why?

OpenCode Go gives you access to powerful open coding models for **$5/month** (then $10/month). This proxy makes those models work seamlessly with Claude Code's interface — no patches, no forks, just set two environment variables and go.

## Features

- **Transparent Proxy** — Claude Code sends Anthropic-format requests, proxy transforms to OpenAI format and back
- **Model Routing** — Automatically routes to different models based on context (default, thinking, long context, background)
- **Fallback Chains** — If a model fails, automatically tries the next one in your configured chain
- **Circuit Breaker** — Tracks model health and skips failing models to avoid latency spikes
- **Real-time Streaming** — Full SSE streaming with live OpenAI -> Anthropic format transformation
- **Tool Calling** — Proper Anthropic tool_use/tool_result <-> OpenAI function calling translation
- **Token Counting** — Uses tiktoken (cl100k_base) for accurate token counting and context threshold detection
- **JSON Configuration** — Flexible config file with environment variable overrides and `${VAR}` interpolation
- **Hot Reload** — Watch config file for changes and reload automatically (off by default)
- **Background Mode** — Run as daemon detached from terminal
- **Auto-start on Login** — Launch on system startup via launchd (macOS)

## Quick Start

### 1. Install

```bash
# macOS / Linux
brew tap samueltuyizere/tap && brew install oc-go-cc

# Windows
scoop bucket add oc-go-cc https://github.com/samueltuyizere/scoop-bucket && scoop install oc-go-cc
```

Or see [INSTALLATION.md](INSTALLATION.md) for more options.

### 2. Initialize Configuration

```bash
oc-go-cc init
```

Creates a default config at `~/.config/oc-go-cc/config.json`. Edit it to add your API key, or set the environment variable:

```bash
export OC_GO_CC_API_KEY=sk-opencode-your-key-here
```

### 3. Start the Proxy

```bash
oc-go-cc serve
```

### 4. Configure Claude Code

```bash
export ANTHROPIC_BASE_URL=http://127.0.0.1:3456
export ANTHROPIC_AUTH_TOKEN=unused
```

### 5. Run Claude Code

```bash
claude
```

## CLI Commands

```
oc-go-cc serve              Start the proxy server
oc-go-cc serve -b           Start in background (detached from terminal)
oc-go-cc serve --port 8080  Start on a custom port
oc-go-cc stop               Stop the running proxy server
oc-go-cc status             Check if the proxy is running
oc-go-cc init               Create default configuration file
oc-go-cc validate           Validate configuration file
oc-go-cc models             List available OpenCode Go models
oc-go-cc autostart enable   Enable auto-start on login
oc-go-cc autostart disable  Disable auto-start on login
oc-go-cc autostart status   Check autostart status
oc-go-cc --version          Show version
```

## Deploying on Railway

`oc-go-cc` can be deployed publicly on [Railway](https://railway.app) with a shared-secret bearer token gating access. Railway auto-detects the Go project via Nixpacks — no Dockerfile is needed. The `railway.json` at the repo root tells Railway how to start the binary, what to healthcheck, and how to restart on failure.

### 1. Create a Railway service

Point Railway at this repository. Nixpacks will build the binary automatically. The start command in `railway.json` runs `oc-go-cc serve` against the checked-in `configs/config.example.json` (env vars override the values you care about). It also `mkdir -p`s `$HOME/.config/oc-go-cc/` first, because `serve` writes a PID file there and Nixpacks containers don't pre-create it.

### 2. Set environment variables

| Variable | Required | Description |
| -------- | -------- | ----------- |
| `OC_GO_CC_API_KEY`   | Yes | Your OpenCode Go API key. |
| `PROXY_AUTH_TOKEN`   | Yes (for public deploys) | Shared secret clients must present in `Authorization: Bearer <token>` (or `x-api-key`). Generate one with `openssl rand -hex 32`. **If unset, auth is disabled** — fine for `localhost`, dangerous on the public internet. |
| `OC_GO_CC_HOST`      | Yes | Set to `0.0.0.0` so the server binds to all interfaces. |
| `OC_GO_CC_PORT`      | Yes | Set to `${{PORT}}` (literal Railway reference) so the server listens on the port Railway assigned. |

The `/health` endpoint is exempt from auth so Railway's healthcheck (`/health`, 30s timeout) keeps working.

### 3. Point Claude Code at the deployed URL

```bash
export ANTHROPIC_BASE_URL=https://<your-service>.up.railway.app
export ANTHROPIC_AUTH_TOKEN=<same value as PROXY_AUTH_TOKEN>
```

Claude Code sends `ANTHROPIC_AUTH_TOKEN` as a bearer token, which the proxy validates against `PROXY_AUTH_TOKEN` using a constant-time comparison.

### Local use is unchanged

Omit `PROXY_AUTH_TOKEN` and the auth middleware becomes a passthrough no-op. A single warning is logged at startup so you know auth is off — perfect for `127.0.0.1` development.
